You can run my project in ways:
1.you can copy paste the code of index.html directly and run it in any online compiler or run by saving the file into html form
2.you can run it in local host by creating server(server.js file) and run the terminal(command prompt) in the folder where files exist and type  
    i)node server.js ---->this  runs the project and returns the url (e.g http:/localhost/3000) copy the link and run it in chrome 
    this runs the project.
